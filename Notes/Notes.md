** To do **
    Watch the video about user centric. 5 videos : one a day for next monday (23/04/18)

** Bash command **
    pwd     == Print Working Directory (enable to know where we are)
    ls      == list files of the current directory
    touch   == create a new file. touch + file name
    rm      == remove file. rm + file name
    cd      == change directory.
    cd ..   == getting in the file above (root)
    cd ../..== getting two files above 
    mkdir   == create directory
    rmdir   == remove (delete) directory. We have to be in the directory containing the directory we want to delete.
    rm -rf  == remove directory and all files in the directory
                r stands for "recursive" : do that for all files beneath
                f stands for force (without asking, just do it)
                rm -rf /    delete everything on your computer
    quit nano editor : ctrl + x

** vocabulary **
    Directory and folder are the exact same thing.
    
** Notes **
    We try to avoid to use absolute path in coding because if one root file changes then everything fall down.
    We tend to use relative path. We use " ./lalalala" the "./" is "in the directory we are currently in". For example for the link to the css file for html.
    One dot . directory we are in
    Two dot .. directory one level above
